<h4>Version 1.3</h4>
<h6>Untextured Raycaster that casts rays on a 2D outlined map to compute distance to objects. The height of each object can thus be determined by the distance the ray travels before reaching it, the further the distance the smaller the object. Also referred to as "fake 3D" or "2.5D". </h6>
