Bug occurs when running .obj objects where you can sort of see through certain parts
which leads to wrong lighting as a results. Certain polygons basically become 
see-through which gives this effect.

I suspect that some polygons structured by the object file have their normals pointing
inside and not outside, which means that some polygons are faced in wrong direction.

Possible solution would be either find out specifically and turn these polygons to
face correctly, perhaps the objects were written for right-handed rendering? (im left).

Another possibility would be to implement two_sided polygons which essentially just copies
the original polygon, and then mirrors it to face the other direction.
